# Technical Documentation

This repo is a place to store technical documentation that I've worked on and have built out over the years. Often I've had difficulty remembering the various documentation needed and required as there are so many requirements. This is an easy to go place that that can be referenced easily to view general files that can be expanded and built upon for later use.
