# Crisis Communications Plan

## Principles of Crisis Communications

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of crisis communications is to mitigate potential reputational damage by providing credible, accurate information about an unfolding crisis  situation  as rapidly as possible and to demonstrate that the organization is responding in a professional, planned and appropriate manner. A key challenge is to maintain public confidence in the company, and in its leadership team.

Research by the global Public Relations firm Ketchum has shown that the key attributes of effective leadership include communicating in an open and transparent way; admitting mistakes; collaborative behavior in finding solutions to problems; a caring relationship with employees; showing respect for different cultures and – most important of all – aligning words with actions.

A company which takes responsibility for managing the consequences of a crisis, and which communicates its actions effectively, can emerge with its reputation intact and with minimal damage to its ongoing business and its relationships with key stakeholders.

### 1.2 Speed of Response

Failure to keep pace with the developing story online may be perceived as disorganized or floundering in its response. Before the development of social media, a realistic target was to issue a first "holding statement" within one hour of notification of an incident. We should aim to issue our first comment, acknowledging that we are aware of the incident, within 15 minutes. The practicality of issuing a statement so quickly means that online channels are the best solution. It is recommended we use our social media outlets (twitter, Facebook, etc.) for initial awareness responses. While the use of social media outlets is popular but not universal among companies, this has become the de facto standard for rapid communication in a crisis and allows instant updates to be posted as new information becomes available.

### 1.3 Accepting Responsibility

After a serious incident, we should be seen to accept responsibility for managing the consequences of the event, and this should be the focus of our communications response. This does not imply accepting liability or culpability for the incident itself, but means that we will do everything in our power to mitigate the negative impact and formulate implement a strategy to rectify the situation.

### 1.4 Appropriate Messaging

The content and tone of public statements, particularly in the early stages of a crisis, is critical in positioning ourselves as a responsible, well-managed organization which is committed to "doing the right thing". Statements should acknowledge the facts and describe the actions taken to date, while expressing concern for those clients and individuals affected.

Once the basic messages have been established, they should be repeated consistently in statements issued via any channel, including press briefings and interviews. Despite the pressure to speculate, we should avoid discussing the potential cause(s), of the incident until those are fully known and an action plan is in place to rectify the situation. All questions on the potential causes and the progress of the investigation should be referred to the leadership team.

### 1.5 Knowing the Audiences

It is easy to become fixated on the demands of the crisis, but we will need to communicate with multiple other audiences, including:

- Other individuals or organizations directly affected
- Employees
- Customers  
- Investors
- Business partners
- Suppliers
- Service providers
- Regulatory agencies
- Local/state/national government

While statements issued to the news media will be read or heard by a wide cross- section of these audiences, there are numerous additional  channels which should be integrated into the overall communications response, including:

- The company website
- Social media platforms (eg. Twitter, Facebook)
- Employee intranet
- Individual or group briefings (eg. for families, employees, unions, shareholders etc.)
- Personal letters from the company
- Customer communications
- Communications from company representatives (eg. law firms/insurers)

Front-line, sales and customer service employees should be briefed on what they can say in response to questions about the situation from customers or members of the public, who may decide to share what they are told via social media.

Marketing and advertising campaigns should be reviewed, to check that they do not contain inappropriate messaging or images.

## Roles, Responsibilities, and Messaging

Numerous parties may be involved in the response to a serious incident. To a greater or lesser degree, all will face pressure to provide information in the immediate aftermath of the event. To avoid confusion and inconsistency, it is important that each party understands its role in the response, the kind of information it can legitimately provide, and the appropriate messaging to use, and in most cases it is imperative that a single spokesperson convey the message or the messaging is conveyed with consistent messaging. The Leadership team will take primary responsibility for messaging, led by the CEO. Below is the contact information and chain of command for the leadership team.

| Contact Name | Position | Phone
| ------------ | -------- | ----- |
| Name One     | Title One | (555) 555-5555 |
| Name Two     | Title Two | (555) 555-5555 |
| Name Three     | Title Three | (555) 555-5555 |

## Using Online Channels

Within a relatively short period of time, the proliferation of social media has fundamentally changed the way in which people access and share information. To adapt to this new environment, the use of online platforms and social media channels should be an integral part of the overall communications response for any airline, and for other parties which may be involved in a major event. Social media channels can be used actively, to share information and to engage in online conversations, or passively, to obtain information and to monitor conversations about the company.

### 3.1 Tips for Developing a Social Media Strategy for Crisis Situations:

1.  We are active on social media, using platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Instagram to support our sales and marketing initiatives and to maintain an ongoing dialogue with customers and online followers. The challenge in a crisis situation is to integrate these platforms into the overall communication response, in order to ensure consistent messaging across all channels.

2. To ensure consistent messaging across all channels, the administration rights for all of the company’s social media channels should either be consolidated within one department, or the individual account "owners" should be named in the crisis communications plan, so they can be easily reached in a crisis and instructed to post the updates released by the communications team. Individuals within the management team who use social media  personally should also be persuaded to limit their comments to the approved messaging. Other employees should also be reminded of the  company’s  social  media policy.

3. Monitoring online conversations about the company is an essential form of business intelligence, particularly during a crisis, and will allow the company to adapt our communication strategy and engage more effectively  with  key influencers as the story develops. There are numerous free and paid online tools which allow companies to monitor online conversations, to measure sentiment about particular issues, and to analyze the impact of the company’s own social media activities. Most of these online monitoring and measurement tools offer upgraded pay- to-use options, but the free options are usually sufficient to develop a broad picture of social media activity. The most popular tools include:
    - [Google Alerts](www.google.com/alerts): Provides an automated alert each time new material about a given subject is posted on the web.
    - [Hootsuite](www.hootsuite.com): A social  media management tool which covers multiple social networks, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WordPress, and Google+. Provides social profiles and analytics.
    - [TweetReach](www.tweetreach.com): Monitors how far tweets travel, measures the actual impact and implications of social media discussions. Allows you to identify the most influential followers.
    - [TweetDeck](https://twitter.com/tweetdeck): A tool  for  scheduling  tweets and monitoring interactions and messages, as well as tracking hashtags and managing multiple accounts.
    - [Klout](www.klout.com): Measures engagement across multiple social media platforms and awards a score based on the accumulated influence.

4. Decisions on whether to actively engage with online conversations about the crisis situation, whether on owned or third-party platforms, should be a policy decision made at a senior level. Staff designated as online "spokespeople", will receive appropriate training and be clear on the communication strategy and messaging. The company’s own social media platforms may be used to engage directly with customers, to acknowledge their concerns or answer questions in real time – for example, about potential service disruption as a result of the event.

5. When responding to online conversations or posts, respond in the same medium – Twitter to Twitter, or Facebook to Facebook.

### 3.1.1 Company Website

The company website is a primary communication  channel,  and usually a  major source of revenues through online booking. It is also one of the first places journalists, customers and others will look for information about an accident or major incident, and how it might affect ongoing operations. All public statements should be posted to the website, with the link referenced in press releases and social media postings.
