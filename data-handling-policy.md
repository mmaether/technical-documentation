# Data Handling Policy

In the course of performing their work, personnel may have access to sensitive or confidential information of various types and classifications. The purpose of this policy is to establish standards for the secure handling of this information.

All information handled in the course of business, whether generated internally by the Company personnel or systems or provided by clients or other third parties, falls into one of five classifications, each having specific requirements with regard to security and confidentiality.

## Explanation of Terms

For purposes of this document, the following terms are to be defined and understood as follows:

- **Company information** and **Company data**: These terms shall be used interchangeably, and shall be understood to include both hardcopy documents and electronic data from all five classifications.

- **Sensitive** and **confidential**: These qualifiers, when applied to Company information, shall also be used interchangeably, and shall indicate information of the classification "Proprietary" or higher.

- **Company premises**: This term shall be understood to encompass both the actual, physical space occupied by the Company’s offices and any external, securely-managed servers utilized in the development of Company services and in the provision of those services to clients and their personnel.

## Access Limitations

The information access provided to Company personnel should be aligned with each individual's job functions and duties.

## Transport and Transfer
Unless specifically authorized by Company management, sensitive Company data is not to be removed or transferred from Company premises, whether in hardcopy form, over the Internet, or on Company-owned or personal devices or media.

When confidential Company information is permitted to be taken or transmitted off-premises, all reasonable precautions should be taken to ensure its security. Devices containing sensitive Company electronic data should, at the very least, be password protected, and ideally, especially when higher classifications of sensitive data are involved, either the data itself or the entire contents of the device should be encrypted.

When in the custody of Company personnel outside of Company premises, devices, media, or documents containing sensitive Company data should never be left unattended. If such data is to be transported via carrier service (e.g., the U.S. Postal Service, UPS, FedEx), the sender must utilize said carrier’s provisions for security as applicable, such as certified mail, package tracking and delivery confirmation, and signature requirement for delivery. Tamper-evident packaging should be used, and electronic data sent via such carriers should be encrypted.

** Unencrypted confidential Company information must never be sent via email.**

## Remote Access
Company personnel may, at the discretion of Company management, be permitted to access Company data remotely. Usage cases include, but are not limited to:

- Individuals working from home/telecommuting, as made necessary by inclement weather, illness of themselves or of family members, or other circumstances.
- Individuals requiring access to Company data for the performance of their job functions and duties while attending or exhibiting at trade shows or similar events.
- Individuals working from the premises of clients or potential clients, for the purposes of sales presentations, technical assistance, systems integration, or other business functions.

The extent and nature of remote access should be determined by the requirements of the specific usage case. For example, an individual working from home or telecommuting from some other location may be permitted secure, encrypted remote control of his or her office computer, enabling that individual to perform their job functions as if they were physically present in the office without compromising the security of the internal Company network and the assets attached to it.

Sensitive Company data accessed remotely is subject to the same restrictions and secure-handling requirements stated in the preceding "Transport and Transfer" section.

Individuals' access to their Company email and calendar from off-premises is permitted at all times unless specifically prohibited by Company management.

## Disposal

The proper and secure disposal of confidential Company data that is no longer needed is an important component of secure data handling. The following procedures must be adhered to when documents or devices containing sensitive information are disposed of, or when sensitive data is removed from devices that are remaining in service.

### Hardcopy Document Disposal

Hardcopy documents (including paper documents, projection transparencies, etc.) that contain sensitive information should always be shredded before disposal. Crosscut shredding is recommended.

### Electronic Data Disposal

Sensitive electronic data stored on devices or reusable media (such as thumb drives) should be destroyed (erased) securely using a U.S. Department of Defense ("DOD") approved method. Reformatting a hard drive or other storage device IS NOT sufficient.

If sensitive data is stored on non-reusable media (such as being burned permanently onto an optical disc), the media should be destroyed or otherwise rendered unreadable before disposal.

### Device Disposal
Before a device capable of storing data (computer hard drive or solid state drive, mobile device, removable storage device, etc.) is disposed of or repurposed, any sensitive data it may contain must be securely erased or rendered unrecoverable.

If a Company device is being decommissioned, discarded, or sold, always assume that it contained sensitive data at some point, and that one of the following measures must be taken before the device passes from Company control.

1. If the device is functional, erase its contents using a DOD-approved method. 
Again, simply reformatting a hard drive or other storage device IS NOT sufficient.
2. If the device is not functional, or if it is not possible to erase its contents securely in accordance with option 1 above (i.e., no compatible software or other methodology is available to perform a DOD-approved erasure of the device), the device must be destroyed or its storage must be physically rendered unreadable/unrecoverable.

Common sense should be used in applying the above measures. If a computer hard drive is inoperable and so cannot be securely erased, remove the drive from the computer and destroy only the drive. If an inoperable device’s internal storage cannot be separated from the device, then the entire device must be destroyed.

Secure destruction of devices, when necessary, will be carried out by means at the discretion of Company management. For reasons of personal safety and both personal and Company liability, CypherWorx personnel should not attempt to destroy such devices themselves.
