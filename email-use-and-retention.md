# Email Use and Retention Policy

The email accounts provided by Company to its personnel are intended to be used for company business only. A small amount of personal use is allowed, so long as it is not excessive or inappropriate, occurs during personal time (such as lunch or other breaks), and does not result in expense or harm to the company or otherwise violate this policy. Use is defined as "excessive" if it interferes with normal job functions, responsiveness, or the ability to perform daily job activities.

Email access is a privilege granted by Company management and may be revoked at any time for inappropriate conduct, including but not limited to:

- Engaging in private or personal business activities.
- Using another employee's email account.
- Allowing anyone else to use your email account.
- Transmitting sensitive or confidential documents or data without authorization or suitably secure encryption. (See also the Company Data Handling Policy, documented separately.)
- Intentionally propagating malware designed to disrupt, impair, compromise the security of, or otherwise harm or interfere with Company networks or systems or those of any other entity or individual.
- Transmitting materials of illegal or pornographic nature, or which could be construed to constitute sexual harassment, promote discrimination of any kind, or otherwise create or contribute to a threatening or uncomfortable workplace environment.
- Use of language which is abusive, profane, discriminatory, threatening, or otherwise objectionable.
- Violating the laws and regulations of the United States or any other applicable state, city, or local jurisdiction.
- Engaging in other unlawful or malicious activities.
Company email accounts are provided through Gmail for Business. As such, the use of said accounts is also subject to the policies and Terms of Service set by Google, which can be found at www.gmail.com/intl/en/mail/help/program_policies.html.

## Safe Computing

In addition to following the preceding rules, all Company personnel should exercise due caution when receiving and responding to email they receive. Do not open or attempt to open email attachments received other than from a known, trusted source. Such attachments may contain malware or other malicious content. Also, do not click on hyperlinks contained in emails unless you are certain of their safety.

## Ownership and Access; No Expectation of Privacy
Company owns the rights to all data and files stored in any company computer system or transmitted over any Company internal network or via Company-provided email accounts, to the extent that such rights are not superseded by applicable trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property laws.

Company also reserves the right to monitor any and all use by employees of company-provided email accounts. All Company personnel should be aware that there is no expectation of privacy in any information or activity conducted, sent, received, performed, or viewed on or with company-provided equipment, email, or Internet access.

## Email Retention

Every email message falls into one of the following three classifications:
1. Retained Records: Messages with content subject to legal retention requirements, such as those pertinent to company finances, purchase or sales transactions, and legal, administrative, or human resources correspondence.
2. Lasting Value: Messages containing information that should be retained due to the operational nature of the message content.
3. Transitory: Routine communication, scheduling, or any other messages not subject to classifications 1 or 2. Examples include meeting or event notices, internal requests for information, announcements, or unsolicited commercial email ("spam").

Messages of the first two classifications should not be permanently deleted without the express authorization of Company management.

With the exception of the above requirements, Company personnel are permitted and expected to manage their own email.
