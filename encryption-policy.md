# Encryption Policy

In the course of performing their duties, personnel may work with electronic files containing sensitive or confidential data. 
Securing this data from unauthorized access, whether by other personnel or by persons or organizations outside the company, 
is clearly important, and failure to do so could have serious legal, financial, or other business consequences for the company.

This document sets out encryption standards for recommended and approved encryption tools and methods.  

## Encryption Standard

Advanced Encryption Standard ("AES") encryption using a 128-bit key ("AES-128") is recommended.

## Password/Passphrase Security

Employees are required to utilize secure passwords or paraphrases. We require employees to:
- Select sufficiently strong passwords or passphrases that include symbols, numbers and characters.
- Store those passwords and passphrases in secure password storage programs approved by the company.

### Strong passwords
The first requirement of password security is that passwords themselves not be easily guessed or easily defeated by 
"brute force" methods. Per AES-128 encryption standards, strong passwords require a password or passphrase of approximately 
32 characters, if it is made up purely of lowercase alphabetic characters. Mixing in uppercase characters and digits 
reduces the required length to 22, and adding punctuation and other symbols will make it stronger yet. For practical purposes, 
so long as mixed-case alphabetics, digits, and symbols are used, a password length of 12 to 15 characters can be approved.

### Storing passwords	

A long and complicated password or passphrase is obviously more difficult to remember, and the problem is only made worse by 
the need to remember many of them. This often leads to the other major mistake people commonly make with password security â€“ 
reusing the same password or passphrase for multiple purposes instead of creating a different one for each use. This obviously 
reduces the difficulty for an intruder dramatically, and seriously weakens the entire point of using encryption in the first 
place.

We allow the use of pre-approved Password Management Software programs which can be extremely helpful in securely storing 
passwords and passphrases, eliminating the need for users to remember multiple complex passwords themselves. Such software 
stores passwords in a secure, encrypted repository, and the user then needs to remember only a single password in order to 
access the rest. (Obviously, that password should be strong, and great care must be taken to prevent it from becoming compromised.) 
Password managers also often include a function to generate strong, random passwords of user-specified length and complexity. 
Such passwords would be extremely difficult for a human to remember, but the use of the password manager makes that unnecessary.
(Password managers also typically integrate with most Web browsers, and can generate and store strong passwords for websites 
and online services). You are required to get approval from the Director of Programming for the use of any Password Management 
Software programs to be certain they meet CypherWorx standards for security and proper password storage.

When it is necessary to securely transmit data electronically or ship it on physical media, encrypted files and their passwords 
or passphrases should never be included in the same physical package or email message. Ideally, and whenever practicable, 
encrypted data and the means to unlock it should be sent by entirely different methods (e.g., an encrypted file sent as an 
email attachment, and the password needed to open it being provided via instant messaging, or even by voice over the telephone).
