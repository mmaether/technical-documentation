# Information Classification Policy

It is a simple and obvious fact that, in the course of doing business, Company is entrusted with client information of varying levels of sensitivity and confidentiality. As examples, business activities involving client information include, but are not limited to:

- Business proposals and negotiations with potential new clients.
- The onboarding process for new client organizations.
- The day to day provision of eLearning and associated services to clients' personnel.
- The creation and management of user accounts for clients' personnel.
- User support and technical assistance.
- Development of new features and functionality, whether as part of the ongoing refinement and expansion of our services, or as required to meet specific client needs.

In addition to client information, Company personnel may, as required by their job functions, have access to internal company data and/or documents of varying sensitivity. In recognition of all of the above, Company has adopted this information classification policy to help manage and protect both Company and client information assets.

**All Company personnel share in the responsibility for ensuring that Company and client information assets receive an appropriate level of protection by adhering to this Information Classification Policy:**

- Company Managers or information "owners" shall be responsible for assigning classifications to information assets according to the standard information classification system presented below. ("Owners" have approved management responsibility. "Owners" do not have property rights.)
- Where practicable, the information category shall be embedded in the information itself.
- All Company personnel shall be guided by the information category in their security-related handling of Company and client information.

All Company and client information, as well as all information entrusted to the Company from potential clients and other third parties, falls into one of five classifications. These classifications are described in the Information Security Classifications table, in order of increasing sensitivity.
