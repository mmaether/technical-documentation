# Security Incident Management Policy

**Purpose**

Implementing solid security policies, blocking unnecessary access to networks and computers, improving user security awareness, and early detection and mitigation of security incidents, are important measures to reduce the risk and drive down the cost of securityincidents. This Policy is intended to both decrease our risk of incidents and to react swiftly and appropriately to any and all security risks.  This standard operating procedure (SAP) policy provides a set of measures that will mitigate information security risks associated with incident management and describes the requirements for dealing with computer security incidents.

## Definitions

**Incident Response Team (IRT):** Personnel responsible for coordinating the response to computer security incidents in an organization. The IRT holds regular meetings to review any incidents that have occurred, and discusses projects relating to IT Security. Emergency meetings may also be called at the discretion of the CEO or Information Security Officer if an incident needs immediate attention. The team members and their rolesinclude:

**Information Security Officer(s) (ISO) -** Advises team of incidents that have occurred and updates members on securityprojects. The ISO serves in an independent capacity at the pleasure of the CEO and the individual responsible for this role may change from time to time depending on the unique needs of the organization.

**Risk Management &amp; Compliance -** Advises team of risk and compliancematters.

**Information Resources (IR):** Any computer printouts, online display devices, magnetic storage media, and all computer-related activities involving any device capable of receiving email, browsing websites, or otherwise capable of receiving, storing, managing, or transmitting electronic data including, but not limited to, mainframes, servers, personal computers, notebook computers, hand-held computers, tablets, distributed processing systems, network attached and computer controlled medical and laboratory equipment (i.e. embedded technology),  smartphones, telecommunication resources, network environments, telephones, fax machines, printers and service bureaus. Additionally, it includes the procedures, equipment, facilities, software, and data that are designed, built, operated, and maintained to create, collect, record, process, store, retrieve, display, and transmitinformation.

**Information Resources Manager (IRM):** The Director of Programming is responsible for management of Company information resources. The designation of an agency information resources manager is intended to establish clear accountability for setting policy for information resources management activities, provide for greater coordination of the agency's information activities, and ensure greater visibility of such activities. The IRM has the authority and the accountability to implement security policies, procedures, practice standards and guidelines.

**Security Incident:** Assessed event of attempted entry, unauthorized entry, or an information attack on an automated information system. It includes unauthorized probing and browsing, disruption or denial of service, altered or destroyed input, processing, storage, or output of information, or changes to information system hardware, firmware, or software characteristics with or without the users' knowledge, instruction, orintent.

### Incident Categories

2.1 Level 1 â€“ These are the least severe and most common types of incidents. They have no widespread effect on any function. Level 1 incidents are handled by the IT / Programming department directly. Incident types and quantities will be tracked and they will be discussed during regular update meetings.

2.2 Level 2 - Incidents that have a small impact on operational functionality but have no impact on the overall business function. Level 2 incidents are handled by the IT / Programming department and will be reported to the CEO or ISO. IT / Programming personnel continue to monitor the incident after remediation and report findings / updates to the CEO and ISO as defined. Incident types and quantities are tracked in Support Hub. Reports are discussed during regular update meetings.

3.3 Level 3 - These are the most severe incidents. They have a major impact on either business, finance or operational functions at Company and may prevent our organization from fulfilling its mission or serving clients. This category also includes incidents that may cause operational or financial damage to Company. Level 3 incidents require an emergency IRT meeting. The incident is handled by the Director of Programming directly, and all steps taken must be approved by either the CEO or ISO. The Director of Programming monitors the incident after the threat has been mitigated, and reports findings to the CEO and ISO on a defined schedule.

The following are examples of the categories of IT security related incidents:

| Incident Categories | Description | Examples |
